This project demonstrates how to accomplish infinite scrolling, in this
case by using WordPress sites with the (v2) WP REST API enabled.

This defaults to ctmirror.org, but you can find sites that suppor the API
by google dorking for the following term:

   inurl:"wp-json/wp/v2/posts/"

Here are some I found:
