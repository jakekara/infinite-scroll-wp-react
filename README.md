This project demonstrates how to accomplish infinite scrolling, in this
case by using WordPress sites with the (v2) WP REST API enabled.

You can check it out live here: https://jakekara.github.io/infinite-scroll-wp-react/

This defaults to ctmirror.org, but you can find sites that suppor the API
by google dorking for the following term:

   inurl:"wp-json/wp/v2/posts/"

Here are some I found:
